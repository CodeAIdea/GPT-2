Developed a customized GPT-2 model using PyTorch, featuring a neural 
architecture with self-attention layers, causal transformers, and optimized 
embedding techniques. This project explores advanced techniques such as flash 
attention and mixed precision training to achieve efficient, high-performance 
processing for language generation tasks. The model is fine-tuned on a large text 
dataset to adapt seamlessly to varied language patterns, making it ideal for 
applications like text summarization and conversational AI.
